# lidar_translator

To run:

Set static IP address like:

IP Address: 192.168.0.15

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.0.1

Then run 

 rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:="192.168.0.10"

Which should start broadcasting the stuff from the lidar. And can run the lidar translator stuff.
